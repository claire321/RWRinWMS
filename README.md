# Relative Wavelength Response in Wavelength Modulation Spectroscopy

### Introduction
- This is an implementation to the algorithm that process experimental current and etalon calibration data. 
- Detailed description of the algorithm please see the published paper.
- This software need your computer to have Matlab 2015b or a compatitable version of Matlab installed.

### Features
- `SimulCali` Tab: process simultaneously calibration data
- `SBS` Tab: process step-by-step calibration data
- `Compare` Tab: compare the above results
